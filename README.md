# AlbumArtCropper-py
A simple python script that takes mp3s' album art and crops them to a 1:1 aspect ratio. I started this project when I realized that the album art for all my music was in the wrong aspect ratio. I didnt really like that since it looked awkward on my music player.

## Installation and Initial running
This project utilizes the eyeD3 libraries as well as Pillow, and you will need to installl then with pip beforehand. Here is the command

```py -m pip install eyed3 Pillow```

It should be straight forward on how to run the python file...

```py <path>```

## Usage

Once prompted, type each letter for the desired path type 
- s - go through all subdirectories
- f - do a singular file
- d - go through a singular directory and exlude subdirectories

After that, just enter your path.
